# System Architecture

## Overview

OpenScienceDLT combines distributed ledger technology (Stellar) with decentralized storage (IPFS) to create a transparent, immutable platform for scientific publishing.

## Core Components

### 1. Research Paper Contract
- Handles submission and metadata storage
- Links to IPFS content
- Tracks paper status and version history
- Manages author identities and credentials

### 2. Peer Review Contract
- Manages review submission and verification
- Tracks reviewer credentials and conflicts
- Links reviews to papers
- Maintains review history and status

### 3. Verification Contract
- Handles independent verification submissions
- Tracks verification methodology
- Links verification results
- Maintains verification status

## Technical Stack

### Blockchain Layer (Stellar)
- Handles all transactions and state changes
- Stores metadata and status information
- Manages identity and credentials
- Provides immutable audit trail

### Storage Layer (IPFS)
- Stores paper content
- Stores review content
- Stores verification data
- Provides content addressing and versioning

### Application Layer
- TypeScript/JavaScript implementation
- Event-driven architecture
- Modular design for extensibility
- Strong typing and validation

## Data Flow

1. **Paper Submission**
   ```
   Author -> IPFS (content) -> Stellar (metadata) -> Event (notification)
   ```

2. **Peer Review**
   ```
   Reviewer -> Validation -> IPFS (review) -> Stellar (status) -> Event
   ```

3. **Verification**
   ```
   Verifier -> Validation -> IPFS (results) -> Stellar (status) -> Event
   ```

## Security Model

- **Identity**: Public key infrastructure for all participants
- **Access Control**: Smart contract-based permissions
- **Content Integrity**: IPFS content addressing
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable blockchain record

## Extensibility

The system is designed for easy extension through:
- Modular contract design
- Event-driven architecture
- Plugin system for validators
- Custom verification protocols

## Future Enhancements

1. **Reputation System**
   - Reviewer scoring
   - Author history
   - Verification track record

2. **Integration APIs**
   - Journal system integration
   - Institution verification
   - Citation tracking

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Automated conflict detection
   - Machine learning for review quality
   - Cross-chain verification
