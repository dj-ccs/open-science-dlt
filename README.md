# open-science-dlt
A decentralized platform for open science publishing using Stellar blockchain

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Prevent suppression of scientific research
- Make peer review process transparent and auditable
- Enable independent verification of research
- Democratize access to scientific knowledge

## Why This Matters

The history of scientific publishing reveals a concerning pattern of knowledge control and manipulation. In the 1950s, Robert Maxwell's Pergamon Press revolutionized academic publishing by standardizing the peer review process. While this established important quality controls, it also created unprecedented opportunities for controlling scientific information:

- Publishers gained the ability to suppress research by rejecting papers
- Intelligence agencies could monitor cutting-edge research through the review process
- Certain entities could maintain exclusive access to blocked research
- The academic publishing industry became a powerful gatekeeper of knowledge

This centralized control of scientific knowledge continues today through commercial academic publishers, creating:
- Paywalls blocking access to publicly-funded research
- Potential manipulation of the peer review process
- Lack of transparency in research verification
- Limited access to negative results and failed experiments

## Our Solution

OpenScienceDLT uses blockchain technology to create an immutable, transparent platform for scientific publishing that:

- Makes all submitted research permanently available
- Creates an auditable peer review process
- Enables independent verification of results
- Prevents selective suppression of research
- Democratizes access to scientific knowledge

By leveraging Stellar's distributed ledger technology and IPFS for content storage, we create an unstoppable platform for open science that cannot be controlled or manipulated by any single entity.

## Key Features

- **Immutable Research Record**: All submissions are permanently stored and timestamped
- **Transparent Peer Review**: Review process tracked on-chain with verified credentials
- **Independent Verification**: Separate verification contracts track reproduction attempts
- **Public Accessibility**: All research publicly available immediately upon submission

## Join the Revolution

Help us build a future where scientific knowledge is:
- Free from manipulation
- Accessible to all
- Transparently reviewed
- Independently verifiable

Together, we can ensure that scientific knowledge serves humanity rather than special interests.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open-science-dlt.git
cd open-science-dlt
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your Stellar account:
```bash
cp config/default.example.json config/default.json
# Edit config/default.json with your Stellar account details
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Git

### Environment Setup

1. **Code Quality Tools**

Install ESLint extension for your IDE:
- VS Code: "ESLint" by Microsoft
- IntelliJ/WebStorm: Enable ESLint in Settings

Configure Prettier:
```bash
# Install Prettier extension
# VS Code: "Prettier - Code formatter"
# Enable format on save in your editor

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Fix formatting
npm run format
```

## 💻 Usage Example

```javascript
const { OpenSciencePlatform } = require('./src/platform/OpenSciencePlatform');
const { ResearchPaper } = require('./src/contracts/ResearchPaper');

// Initialize platform
const platform = new OpenSciencePlatform({
  network: 'testnet', // or 'public' for mainnet
  ipfsNode: 'https://ipfs.infura.io:5001'
});

// Submit research paper
async function submitPaper() {
  const paper = new ResearchPaper({
    title: 'Novel Research',
    abstract: 'Research abstract...',
    authors: ['PUBLIC_KEY_1'],
    content: 'Full paper content...'
  });

  const result = await platform.submitPaper(paper);
  console.log('Paper submitted:', result.hash);
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The platform can be configured using environment variables or the `config/default.json` file:

```json
{
  "stellar": {
    "network": "testnet",
    "secretKey": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
  },
  "ipfs": {
    "node": "https://ipfs.infura.io:5001",
    "gateway": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs"
  },
  "platform": {
    "minReviews": 3,
    "minVerifications": 2,
    "reviewTimeout": 604800
  }
}
```
